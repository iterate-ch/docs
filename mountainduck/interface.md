````

````{group-tab} Windows

![Task Bar Menu Windows](_images/Task_Bar_Menu_Windows.png)

Right-click on the taskbar and select *Taskbar setting → Notification area → Select which icons appear on the taskbar*. Make sure Mountain Duck is selected in the list.
````

`````

```{admonition} macOS only
:class: tip
Make sure there is enough space left on right side of the notch or application menu items to make sure the _Mountain Duck_ is visible in the the system status bar.
```

### Auto start

You can choose to automatically open Mountain Duck when logging in. Refer to [Preferences](preferences.md#login-item). Re-opening the application will open previously mounted volumes. If you choose *Enable Login Item* and *Save Workspace* in *Preferences → General* and do not manually eject the volume prior to reboot it will reconnect after login.

## Bookmarks

Choose *Open Connection…* to add a new bookmark or *<Bookmark> → Edit Bookmark* to change properties.

```{note}
Bookmarks are shared between [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) and Mountain Duck.
```

### Connect Mode

- **Default:** Use setting from *Preferences*
- **Online:** Do not synchronize any file to your computer. You can only access this volume when a connection is possible to the server or cloud storage. Files are accessed on demand from the remote when opened and do not take up any local disk space.

```{tip}
In _Online_ connect mode, changes to a file are immediately uploaded and in sync when an application has finished saving a file.
```

- **Smart Synchronization:** Directories can be browsed when offline and files opened are made available for later offline access. You can explicitly make files available offline using the [context menu](connect/sync.md#keep-offline). See [Smart Synchronization](connect/sync.md).
```{tip}
In _Smart Synchronization_ connect mode, files are copied to a local cache for faster access prior synchronization with the server in the background.
```

```

### Nickname

The nickname determines the display of the bookmark in the menu and can be customized.
```{tip}
The nickname determines the name of the mounted volume in Finder.app on macOS or drive in File Explorer on Windows. Also refer to [Mount Location](preferences.md#mount-location).
```

### Labels

```{note}
Version 4.0 or later required.
```
Assign multiple labels to bookmarks. Bookmarks are grouped in folders in the status bar menu by their assigned labels.

```{image} _images/Taskbar_Menu_Bookmark_Groups_Large_Icons_Windows.png

:width: 400px
```

### Read-Only Volume

Select *Options: Read Only* in the bookmark to mount the volume as read-only and disallow any write operations on the remote disk.

### Drive Letter (Windows)

Always assign the same drive letter to the mounted volume.

```{note}
The number of concurrent connected bookmarks is limited by the number of available drive letters. You can have a total of 26 drives on your system.
```

## Filter

```{note}
Version 4.4 or later required.
```

You can search for bookmarks with the filter input field in the menu. Bookmarks not matching the input are greyed out.

:width: 400px
```

## Bookmark Status

The bookmark can show three different status lights:

- **No light:** No current connection to this bookmark.
- **Green light:** Currently connected to this bookmark. The bookmark is completely synced and idle.
- **Orange light:** Currently connected to this bookmark. There is at least one active process.

## Connect

Choose *<Bookmark> → Connect* to mount the server as a volume in the *Finder.app* on macOS or the *File Explorer* on Windows. You can connect to multiple servers and have several volumes mounted. All operations on the remote files and folders can then be performed like on local files.

```{tip}
You can just select the menu item with the bookmark name to connect, too. If you are already connected, selecting the menu item will reveal the volume in *Finder.app*.
```

### Connect Using the Command Line Interface

You can mount volumes using your command-line interface (CLI) by opening a bookmark file.

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} macOS

Use
`open -a "Mountain Duck" ~/Library/Group Containers/G69SCX94XU.duck/Library/Application Support/duck/Bookmarks/*.duck` in *Terminal.app*

````

````{group-tab} Windows

Enter the commmand `<path to Mountainduck.exe> %AppData%/Cyberduck/Bookmarks/<Bookmarkfile>` in *cmd.exe*.

````
`````

## Notifications

Notifications of the connection status are posted to the *Notification Center* of the operating system.

- *Filesystem mounted*
- *Filesystem unmounted*
- *Errors:* If there is a network connectivity issue while the remote server is mounted, an alert is displayed that allows you to retry the connection or disconnect and unmount the volume.
- [Sync Notifications](connect/index.md#notifications)

## Context Menu in Finder and Windows File Explorer

A context menu in *Finder* on macOS and *File Explorer* on Windows allows various actions on files.

```{image} _images/Context_Menu_Windows.png
:alt: Context Menu (Windows)
:width: 600px
```

```{admonition} macOS only
:class: tip

Please make sure to enable the Mountain Duck [Integration](#context-menu-in-finder-and-windows-file-explorer) in *System Preferences → Extensions → Finder Extensions*.
For **macOS Ventura and later**, the setting can be found in *System Preferences → Privacy & Security → Extensions → Added Extensions*.
```

### Sync Options

*Keep Offline on Local Disk* or *Delete on Local Disk* to manage caching status.
Refer to [Sync Options](connect/sync.md#keep-offline).

### Reload

Changes from the server are not immediately visible. The folder listing in the file browser may become outdated when another application adds, removes, or modifies files on the server. Mountain Duck periodically polls for changes for open folders in _Finder.app_ on macOS or _File Explorer_ on Windows about every minute in both _Online_ and _Smart Synchronization_ connect modes. Choose *Reload* from the context menu to refresh the directory listing.

```{admonition} Windows only
:class: tip

Use _F5_ in _File Explorer_ to refresh the folder listing.
```

```{tip}
Enable the *Index Files* option in [*Preferences → Sync*](preferences.md#index-files) to allow new files on the remote storage to be detected periodically for previously opened directories regardless of any open window for the folder in _Finder.app_ on macOS or _File Explorer_ on Windows in _Smart Synchronization_ connect mode.
```

### Share

- *Share…:* Create an URL to share with someone else to allow downloading the file or folder.
